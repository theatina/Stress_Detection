I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.

My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",899,1,0.6,1526500977,3,7.407909118,252,24.5,37.54,76.81,5.03,84.0,14.68,92.06,61.51,21.43,17.86,11.9,0.0,0.0,4.76,1.19,3.57,5.56,13.49,9.13,8.33,7.14,3.17,15.87,2.78,1.98,1.59,1.59,1.59,3.57,0.79,2.78,0.79,1.59,0.4,17.06,5.56,0.0,5.95,4.76,12.3,2.38,1.59,0.4,1.59,1.59,5.16,1.19,0.0,0.79,0.4,2.38,0.4,1.59,0.0,0.0,3.97,1.19,1.59,0.79,0.4,0.0,8.73,6.75,0.79,11.11,0.4,4.76,5.95,1.98,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.71,1.19,1.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.79,2.78,3.17,0.79,3.0,2.75,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.73472,1.59349,1.87673,1.0,1,8.581544402,-0.040515152,"{'sadness': 0.15862368047237396, 'joy': 0.0029381182976067066, 'love': 0.0010643007699400187, 'anger': 0.8352633118629456, 'fear': 0.0017513512866571546, 'surprise': 0.0003592578286770731}",anger,0.8352633118629456,"{'not depression': 0.09356988966464996, 'moderate': 0.8890194296836853, 'severe': 0.017410635948181152}",moderate,0.8890194296836853

We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started.

I was wondering what would be the best way for me going about getting into rehab for my cocaine addiction and since I don’t have insurance if they would even accept me with no criminal background and it’s not going to be court ordered admission but a voluntary self admission to the facility. Feel free to pm me if you like with advice if you rather do that than reply to this post.

At the moment my prediction is to spend the year attending classes, applying for scholarships, and working during the day before couch hopping with a few friends for a month or 2 and spending the rest of the time staying in hostels when I can or sleeping on the streets when I can't before hopefully getting into college where I'll have a reliable bed. TL;DR: Working on boosting my resume, making friends that I can couch hop with for some time, and getting a paying job.

The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year.

The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year.

How can I talk with my buddy in a polite way about the matter, that when he invites me over I'd prefer it to be bro time without coming across as an asshole or that I'm against his GF as a person which I'm totally not! Again, she's really sweet and he has every right to want his GF to come over to, I'm just tired of the surprise third wheel through the most goose bump inducing conversations and want some strategies how I can communicate with my friend that I don't like sitting through that.
